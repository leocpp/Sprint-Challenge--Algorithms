#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n)
It is a while loop based on a magnitude of n.

b)
O(n**2)
It is nested loops on n.  Especially when n is very large.

c)
O(n)
It is a recursion based on the size of bunnies (n)

## Exercise II
Start from the middle. Move half way between the top if it does not break.  Move down half way between the ground if it breaks.  Repeat.

O(Log(n))
